<summary>Rules</summary>

- An upfront payment of half of the full price is required. Arguing with me, attempting to haggle on the price or requesting the lines first will result in being blocked.
- You may NOT use my voice to slander me by making me say something that will get me into trouble.
- You may NOT hire me for porn. This will instantly get you blocked.
- You may NOT use samples of my voice for anything porographic or illegal (ie. Using my voice in the background of snuff videos). You will be reported.

- You may NOT post DMs with me on [r/choosingbeggars](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/) or anywhere else in an attempt to claim that my prices are unreasonable or that I'm scamming you.
- Begging for free work will immediately get you blocked. I don't care if little Timmy needs his funny lines. You pay me, or you're not getting anything from me.
- Screaming at me to hurry up will not make me hurry up. In fact, I might charge you extra for that.
- Hiring me just to request a refund is strictly forbidden. If you hire me and don't like my lines, You will NOT get a refund. Continuing to ask for a refund or posting me online as a scammer will get you blocked and reported.

- Crediting me is not required but EXTREMELY appreciated. Please credit me in your video/game or other project as `{character} - https://pikakid98.github.io/`. `Jordan Robson/Pikakid98 - https://pikakid98.github.io/` also works. But if I get a name change, I may request you to change this to my new name and/or a new website. Refusal to do so will result in a request to take the video down or remove my lines from the game.
- Using my existing voice samples and/or new ones for the purpose of YouTube Poops is allowed (Unless the YTP is made specifically to mock me.. In a serious way, I mean). But please credit me.
- If you send me lines filled with offensive language (aka. `N****r`, `Fa***t`, `Tr***y`) you will INSTANTLY be blocked.
- Sending me an infected file in an attempt to scam me will result in blocking and reporting

By submitting a request for voice work, you agree that I will partially own the legal rights to my voice. And if I request to no longer be associated with you, you MUST comply and remove my voice lines and name all together.
